# 🚀 MemeToken Launch Engine (EVM)

The **Pumpfun evm smart contract** is an all-in-one smart contract system built for rapid token deployment on EVM-compatible chains. Inspired by the viral mechanics of Solana’s Pump.fun, this version is custom-built for **scalable launches, fair pricing, and seamless Uniswap integration** — currently live on the **Monad Testnet**.

## 🧩 Core Features

- 🎯 **One-Click Token Creation**  
  Launch a meme token, utility token, or community asset in seconds — just define your name, symbol, and supply.

- 📈 **Built-in Bonding Curve**  
  Linear bonding curve pricing model helps early buyers benefit while keeping price discovery transparent.

- 🤖 **Autonomous Liquidity Handling**  
  Tokens can be bought and sold directly from the contract without relying on traditional AMMs — powered by on-chain curve logic.

- 🌊 **Auto Uniswap Migration**  
  Once liquidity goals are met, the contract automatically boots a Uniswap V2/V3 pool for open market trading.

- 🔐 **Full On-Chain Execution**  
  All minting, pricing, and liquidity logic is on-chain, maximizing decentralization and auditability.

- 🔄 **EVM Compatibility**  
  Written in Solidity and deployable across any EVM chain. Works with Hardhat, Foundry, MetaMask, and more.

## ⚙️ Recent Updates

### 🔄 Uniswap Liquidity Migration  
Liquidity is automatically bridged to Uniswap once minimum curve volume is reached — no manual steps needed.

### 🧑‍⚖️ Admin Control Options  
Supports optional authority revocation or timed lockups to ensure trustless or semi-custodial launch models.

### 📊 Metrics Dashboard (Coming Soon)  
A UI is in the works to visualize price, curve progress, migration status, and trading volume in real-time.
